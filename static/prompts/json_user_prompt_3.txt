Here is the Python code that calculates the probabilities of each player finishing last in the game of Speed Bingo:
```python
import random

def simulate_game(n, k, sheets):
    # Simulate the game
    numbers = []
    for sheet in sheets:
        numbers.extend(sheet)
    random.shuffle(numbers)

    # Keep track of which player finishes last
    last_player = -1
    player_counts = [k] * n

    for number in numbers:
        for i, sheet in enumerate(sheets):
            if number in sheet and player_counts[i] > 0:
                player_counts[i] -= 1
                if player_counts[i] == 0:
                    last_player = i

    return last_player

def calculate_probabilities(n, k, sheets):
    # Simulate the game many times
    num_simulations = 1000000
    last_player_counts = [0] * n

    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        last_player = simulate_game(n, k, sheets)
        last_player_counts[last_player] += 1

    # Calculate the probabilities
    probabilities = [count / num_simulations for count in last_player_counts]
    return probabilities

# Read the input
n, k = map(int, input().split())
sheets = []
for _ in range(n):
    sheet = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sheets.append(sheet)

# Calculate the probabilities
probabilities = calculate_probabilities
